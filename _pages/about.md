The Satellite Training event has been organised to bring together the community of RSEs who deliver training to share and discuss ideas and best practice.
We have identified four loose themes within which presenters will provide talks in the morning to be followed by discussion sessions after lunch, these are:

- Delivery Styles and Techniques
- Development of Training Materials
- Policy, Culture, and Resourcing
- Developing RSEs to deliver training

The event will finish with some feedback from the discussion groups and discussion group chairs will provide a brief report which will be hosted here and publicised to support RSEs who train.
