The Satellite Training event has been orginised to bring together the community of RSEs who deliver training to share and discuss ideas and best practice.
We have identified four loose themes whthin which presenters will provide talks in the morning to be followed by discussion sessions after lunch, these are:

- Delivery Styles and Techniques
- Devlopment of Training Materials
- Policy, Culture, and Resourcing
- Developing RSE's to deliver training

The event will finish with some feedback from the discussion groups and discussion group chairs will provide a brif report which will be hosted here and publicised to support RSEs who train.
