## Abstract

> Experienced RSEs have a specialist and very valuable, but sometimes under-appreciated, skill set - a range of often niche technical skills paired with an understanding of the research lifecycle that can take several years of experience to develop. Ask any RSE how they developed the skills they have today and you’re likely to get a slightly different answer that probably brings together a combination of training courses, on-the-job training and perhaps a few serendipitous opportunities, or technical mishaps, along the way! In this talk, I’ll look at the importance of developing learning pathways that make the path to becoming an experienced RSE more structured and efficient. This is a vital step as we further professionalise the RSE role and look for ways to address the growing skills gap and demand for RSE capabilities within the research community.
