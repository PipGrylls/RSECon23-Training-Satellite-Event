Here we give a little more information on what each loosely defined theme will focus on. We have four themes:

- Delivery Styles and Techniques
- Devlopment of Training Materials
- Policy, Culture, and Resourcing
- Developing RSE's to deliver training

> ## Delivery Styles and Techniques
>
> There are many ways to deliver effective training, from in person lectured material to remote self directed learning.
> This theme encourages participants to share their experence in delivering training in diffrent styles.
> Participants are encouraged to reflect on their pedagogy and think about how they can use others experence to augment their own practice.

> ## Devlopment of Training Materials
>
> Developing quality training materials is a monumental challange.
> There are quoted figures of one hour of delivered material taking ~50 hours to develop.
> Such an investment of time requires we understand what good materials look like and how we can improve our development practice.
> Participants should be ready to share their exprence of devloping materials and examples of their materials.
> Reflection on the exprences of others that could compliment their devlopment styles is encouraged.
>

> ## Policy, Culture, and Resourcing
>
> A large portion of training is championed by committed individuals, reciving funding, recognition, and time to devote to this training is a systemic issue.
> This mimics the early challanges of reseach software engineering, we will look at the ways we can influence policy to acchive:
>
> - Recognition for the importance of quality training delivered at the correct time.
> - Time and funding for the devlopment of training and trainers
> - Acknolagement of the effort for creating training materials and their value to instutions and the UK reseach infrastructure.
>
> Participants should share expriences of sucesses and faliures in getting recognition on the above topics.
> The result should be actionalble items that can be formed into a coordinated policy push on UK higher education to acheive these goals.

> ## Developing RSEs to deliver training
>
> We the RSEs are at the heart of all the above themes.
> To be able to deliver quality training we must continually improve and adapt our practices as well as train other RSEs to train.
> This theme looks at how we can best devlop ourselves and inspire other RSEs to get into training.
> Participants should come ready to discuss resources and ideas that have had a significat impact on their practice.
> Participants should also be ready to discover new ideas a resources that can devlop them further and that they can share onwards.
