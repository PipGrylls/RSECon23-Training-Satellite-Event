## Abstract

> This talk will present the outcomes of the "Modern Training for Modern Fortran" audience-led panel, scheduled on Tuesday at RSECon23. The aim of the panel was to showcase our current Fortran training, and ideas for improvement and future training. We invited all RSEs to provide feedback and suggestions to guide future material throughout the panel, focusing on a range of themes such as best practice, modern Fortran, and Fortran for HPC.
